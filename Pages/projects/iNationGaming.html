            <p>iNation is small startup my friends and I are working on. We have been working on this since August 2012. We have slowly been making progress on attracting bigger crowds and finding ways to make revenue. We want to bring a whole new level of gaming to our city in Laredo,Tx to grow the gaming competitive scene. We have big plans, but as the majority of our members are in college it is hard to host events consistenly. But we are slowly growing and will be looking to invest on an actual business location.</p>
