            <p>iNation is small startup my friends and I were working on. We started working on in August 2012. We slowly made progress on attracting bigger crowds and finding ways to make revenue. We want to bring a whole new level of gaming to our city in Laredo,Tx to grow the gaming competitive scene. We had big plans, but as the majority of our members are in college it was hard to host events consistenly. We tried to raise 40,000 to invest on an actual business location. But we were not able to meet the requirement. Shortly after we decided that continuing this wasn't a smart decision, so May 2014 was when operations stopped.</p>

                  In iNationGaming I was in charge of a team of 8 people. I would help plan the different events from College Station, Tx even though the events where in Laredo, Tx and help promoting, organizing the business side of things, and running the gaming tournaments.
