    <p>I am a student at Texas A&M University getting a bachelor of science in computer science with a minor in business. I'll be graduating Dec 2016 so I'm currently looking for a part time job during the school year for the year 2015. I am a young entrepreneur that is interested in computers, web development, programming, leading edge technology and startups. I try my best to attend Hackathons, since I really enjoy being able to work on something new for 24-48 hours straight bringing a new idea to live with the help of a team.</p>
