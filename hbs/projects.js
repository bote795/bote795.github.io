	"Detail": "Aggies Invent is a 48 hour event in which you work on a problem pitched in from an industry partner and develop a solution. You then try to sell your solution. This years theme was 'Making the Internet of Things Come Alive in 48 Hours'. There were 60 people chosen from 185 applicants. Our team name was Delta CPC we worked on developing a wrist band called BandTrack that would track a person using iBeacons. This could be used to keep tracking of patients and doctors. When a disease is found on a person you can go back through the patients footsteps and find who that person interacted with to be able to quartine them as well. But thats not all this can be used to trigger certain events such as changing the environment like populating the users data when he walks into the doctors room, changing the music, the tv channel, the lights, etc. BandTrack would also contain the patients medical history and be linked to a cloud where the patients history would be dynamically changed as well. Our repo that doesnt contain the app that we worked on in that current period can be found here.",

Then it scrapes anichart.net for the upcoming anime and uses NaiveBayes to return the top 6 relevant animes to the user. The features that it used were genres and staff.",
